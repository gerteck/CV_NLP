This serves as a repository to store files and instructions on how to 
conduct fake image classification using Computer Vision and fake news predicitions
using Natural Language Processing.

Contents of this repository include:

- **Fake Image Classification** using machine learning, consisting of:
  - Dataset statistics analysis
  - Data pre-processing
  - Model selection & configuration
  - Hyper-parameter tuning
  - Early stopping
  - Model training
  - Model Evaluation


- **Fake new predictions** using machine learning, consisting of:
  - Selecting Pretrained Model (from huggingface.co community)
  - Loading Dataset and Splitting train-test ratio
  - Loading Tokenizer
  - Defining Model Architecture and Hyperparameters
  - Defining Train and Evaluation Functions
  - Training and Evaluation
  - Utilizing model for Fake News Predicitions
  - ++ Explaining Predictions with LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
